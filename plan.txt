Plans for web features (Phase II aligned):

We'd have to figure out a reason why students would use this service. What draws them in? The planner?

Phase II (Architecture & navigation best practices):
- Single unified Next.js app under `web/` (one URL base; no cross-port redirects between apps)
- Standard route flow: `/` → `/login` → (optional) `/onboarding` → `/browser` → `/planner`
- Separate pages/features (important):
  - Course Browser (`/browser`): full catalog search + filters + build a selected list (shortlist/plan)
  - Course Planner (`/planner`): 4-year grid planning using the selected list; **no full catalog browser embedded on this page**
- Navigation: use Next.js `Link` / router push for internal routing; avoid hardcoded full URLs
- Shared state: one persisted data model used by both pages (shared data, separate UIs), migrate legacy keys (`plan`, `plannerV1`) → single key (e.g. `plannerV2`)
- Optional best-practice course picking: planner slot → link to `/browser` with query params → assign → return to `/planner`

1. course planning system (two core features: browser + planner):
– currently students have to go through the pdf and find the courses, put it down somewhere on a piece of paper or something, and then
count the number of courses/etc.
– our goal is to make an interface where they can easily and conveniently choose the courses that they want, put it down, and then verify
if they are good for the graduation requirements or maximum courses allowed, number of credts offered, etc.
– for prerequisite mentioned in the course description, we can add the feature that, based on the user's input about the courses that've already taken
so far, that automatically tells me whether they're missing a prerequisite, when they select this course. Add this feature later once core features are
done.
– add a button on top right corner to switch system modes (light/dark)
– I'm thinking about drawing insight from some college course academic catalog for the general entry of all courses
– Keep browser and planner on separate pages: browse in `/browser`, plan in `/planner` (no combined page UI)




Next steps for database:
1. add the grade
2. add the department for all courses; put courses under them in json tree
– English, Languages, Mathematics, Science, HPR, Social Science, Computer Science, Performing Arts, Visual Arts, Study Abroad
3. use title for prerequisite
4. identify any corrupted names from the responses by AI


sample field in json tree:

{
  "department": "Mathematics",
  "courses": [
    {
      "title": "course title",
      "description": "description.",
      "department": "department",
      "rigor": 1, //1, 2 or 3 for reg, advanced, cl respectively
      "gesc": false,
      "ppr": false,
      "term": "term",
      "offered_in_25-26": true,
      "required": false, //this is whether or not required for department credits. 
      "grades": [9, 10], // this is the target class year that the course will be offered to; if it is offered to all classes, simply put 9, 10, 11, and 12 all on there
      "prerequisite": ["Exact course title", false] //false or true is whether or not the class needs permission of departments. 
    },
    ...
  ]
}


Notes:

– what should we do about the Innovation Trimester ITri?

– For "STATISTICS I (GESC) winter" and "STATISTICS II (GESC) spring", ignore for now about this course, since information very unclear. 

– for "UPPER-LEVEL LATIN", ignore for now since it's unclear how the course registration works exactly.

- For CL TOPICS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE A and CL TOPICS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE B, it should be two different,
separate json fields, each json having the same information except the true and false for the state of
being offered or not in 2025-26. 

– Clearly examine the subheaders for the arts classes. For example, in the class "ART OF DANCE", delete the 'daytime' description from subheader.
– delete those classes that are offered as "after-school tem" or "physical exertion activity", that are not real classes. 







### **1. Single Specific Course**  
A single named course is required (e.g., *“Prerequisite: World History”*).


### **2. Permission of the Department/Faculty**  
No specific course is required; instead, permission from the department or faculty is mandated (e.g., *“Prerequisite: permission of the department”*).


### **3. Combination of a Specific Course and Permission**  
Either a specific course or departmental permission is acceptable (e.g., *“Prerequisite: Arabic I or permission of the department”*).


### **4. Co-Requisite**  
A concurrent course must be taken alongside the target course (e.g., *“Co-requisite: Advanced Precalculus or Precalculus with permission of the department”*).


### **5. Multiple Courses**  
Two or more courses are required (e.g., *“Prerequisites: Biology and Chemistry”*).


### **6. Written Proposal Approval**  
For independent study courses, a formal proposal approved by advisors is required (e.g., *“Prerequisite: written proposal approved by the academic advisor, project advisor, department head, and dean of faculty”*).


### **7. Specific Grade Level with Permission**  
Permission is granted based on grade level (e.g., *“Prerequisite: seniors; juniors with permission of the department”*).


### **8. Combination of Multiple Courses and Permission**  
Multiple courses are required, plus departmental permission (e.g., *“Prerequisites: United States History or CL United States History; permission of the department”*).











































2. study resources hub: 
– holds various resources for various classes, especially math and sciences 
– For certain classes that we have enough information, we can ask teachers for course syllabus
