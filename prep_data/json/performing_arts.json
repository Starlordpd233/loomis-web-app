      "description": "Have you ever wondered how music works? How do pitch and rhythm make a melody catchy? What makes one chord sound more emotional than another chord? Beginning with the basic elements of music theory \u2014 note reading, scales and modes, key and time signatures, intervals and chords, and basic melody writing \u2014 this course works to build the musical skills necessary to read, write, and understand melodies, chord progressions and bass lines, seventh chords in inversion, and reading music over four clefs (chorale or quartet style). Students also will begin harmonic analyzation skills. In addition, this course introduces non-western approaches to harmonization and musical organization. The course emphasizes ear training, interval and chord recognition, beginning sight-singing, and melodic dictation. Students will utilize various music theory websites and will explore basic compositional techniques using electronic music notation software. By term\u2019s end, students should possess the skills needed to place out of beginning music theory at the college level. No previous theory, vocal, or keyboard skill is required.",
