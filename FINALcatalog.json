Organized around the study of global literature, this course allows students to study short stories, memoirs, novels, dramas, and poetry. Writing progresses from the construction of single paragraphs to multi-paragraph compositions, developing students' skills in crafting both interpretive essays and personal narratives and leading to their final writing project, which develops and combines both styles of writing into a single, coherent essay. Throughout the year, the course emphasizes vocabulary, grammar, and punctuation. Representative readings include Sophocles' Antigone, Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, poetry, short stories, and classic and contemporary fiction.",

In doing so, we will discuss how banned books reflect the cultures in which they are written. Readings will include texts banned on political grounds (e.g., Fahrenheit 451, Wild Swans), on religious grounds (e.g., Slaughterhouse-Five, The Satanic Verses), on moral grounds (e.g., \"The Wife of Bath's Tale,\" The Handmaid's Tale, The Bluest Eye), and for other controversial content (e.g., The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Drown).",

Why?\" Ghost stories have been around for as long as people have been; they have long served as the vehicles through which societies and individuals express their fears, traumas, and things best swept under the rug. If history is written by winners, then ghost stories are written by losers \u2014 or, those disenfranchised seeking to reclaim their voice. Spanning all forms and all cultures, the ghost story is a universally employed medium to commune with things that most would prefer stay under the bed. In this course, students will learn not only about the many ghosts of our society and how they take form, but also of art as a form of activism and a memorial of past injustices. The course will emphasize ideas of the importance of truth-telling and the power of old wives' tales, fairy tales, or the stories told by those we all too often dismiss as crazy. Representative texts might include Ahmed Saadawi's Frankenstein in Baghdad, Carmen Maria Machado's Her Body and Other Parties, Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre, and others.",

In this course, we will read the stories of individuals and groups who have journeyed to new places\u2014often out of a desire for a better life but just as often because of involuntary displacement or the need to escape horrific circumstances. Of course, with this change of region, country, or continent comes not only some form of severance from the old place and the old culture but the need to cope with the strangeness of a new country and culture. Consequently, many of the questions we will ask of these texts will concern personal identity\u2014how much is it tied to place? Does a new country or place mean a new identity? What does it mean to reconstruct one's life in a new place? Migration is not a narrow or isolated experience\u2014there's a broad range of groups who have experienced and written about this experience\u2014from Irish immigrants fleeing the 1840s Irish famine to the Great Migration in the early-to-mid-20th century to modern migrants fleeing poverty and political strife in Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Potential texts might include Wilson's Joe Turner's Come and Gone, Adichie's Americanah, Cisneros' House on Mango Street, Nayeri's The Ungrateful Refugee: What Immigrants Never Tell You or The Penguin Book of Migration Literature.",

Through exploration of satirical novels and pop culture publications alike, this course explores how writers use wit and irony to challenge norms, expose hypocrisy, and spark conversation. Along the way, students examine both how and why satire works, considering in the process the role of humor, hyperbole, mockery, understatement, and other tools of the trade.

This course will explore magical realism in its Latin American context and across cultures, in prose, poetry, and film. Beginning with the works of M\u00e1rquez and Borges, the course will attempt to isolate a set of characteristics that define magical realism. From there, students will explore how other authors have experimented with magical realism around the world and compare how those artists have utilized magical realism in their own ways. From the works of Lin Manuel Miranda to Kazuo Ishiguro and Jesmyn Ward, the class will see how the threads of magical realism can connect Latin America and the wider world and how place and genre can open a broader understanding of the ways artists manipulate reality to develop meaning.",

          "description": "Shakespeare is widely recognized as among the greatest\u2014and certainly most influential\u2014writers in the history of the English language. What makes his works endure? This course gives students the opportunity to explore this question for themselves, offering a deep dive into selected plays and sonnets. Students will consider how these texts were staged and received in their original Elizabethan and Jacobean contexts as well how they continue to be reinterpreted for modern audiences. Through close textual analysis and discussion of theatrical conventions across centuries, students will uncover the richness of Shakespeare's language and probe its dramatic potential. Selected texts will reflect a range of genres, and may include plays such as Henry IV, Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, King Lear, The Tempest, and The Merchant of Venice.",

Spanning a period from roughly the mid-1910s through the mid-1930s, the Harlem Renaissance was a time when mass migration to Northern cities brought together numerous African-American writers, artists, scholars, and musicians in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City. This course will focus on some of the prominent writers of the movement in an attempt to uncover the stylistic tendencies of their work and the impact those writings had, both on other writers of the period and on the larger culture as a whole. Students will also experience a selection of art, music, and essay as they develop strategies for understanding what bound these artists together into a generally accepted \"movement\" and for determining how their work still influences writers today. Students will be expected to connect their close reading of individual texts to broader literary and social context. Readings might include texts such as Harlem Shadows, When Washington Was in Vogue, Quicksand, and The Blacker the Berry, and the course will also examine music, poetry, art, and essay from the period.",

          "description": "Computers and computing have had such an impact on the modern world that it's easy to overlook the breadth of their influence. This course invites students to do the opposite: closely examine the role and impact that computers have on the human world. The course operates from the premise that it is imperative to understand not only how technologies function, but also how they interface with the ways we work, learn, play, and socialize. Our primary mode of exploring these questions will be through an older technology - prose writing. We'll begin by defining what algorithms are and how they feed off data. We'll then turn and examine specific categories of technology and how they impact parts of what it means to be human. Topics might include social media algorithms, fitness and health monitoring, algorithms in finance, and artificial intelligence. We'll also explore the ethical questions surrounding computing such as algorithmic bias, the attention economy, and questions of data privacy. In fitting with the PHI's drive to \"make something and make a difference\", the writing in this course will all engage directly with audiences that have direct stakes in the content of the course. Examples of this might include engaging authors about their work, reaching out to legislators, writing amicus briefs for current court cases, or connecting with local community members or organizations through writing. Familiarity with programming or previous coursework in computer science is not required.",

This course is not confined to one scientific discipline but will explore a variety of topics which might include public health, particle physics, astrobiology, or cybernetics. At times, students will choose the scientific topics that most intrigue them for their written pieces. For instance, one student might write an abstract distilling a groundbreaking paper in particle physics, while another pens a persuasive article for the public on the need for increased funding to address mosquito-borne disease.

This course explores the histories of premodern societies which have most commonly been deemed \u201cclassical,\u201d focusing on the multicultural worlds of ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Along the way, students will question what it means to be classical and will challenge traditional narratives rooted in limited understandings of Greek and Roman history. Through group discussions, reflective writing, and thesis-building exercises, students will learn to analyze and interpret ancient primary sources, identify themes and issues related to the study of ancient societies, and appreciate cultures removed in time from our own by thousands of years. Students will also learn to understand and evaluate how narratives about the ancient world have been used and misused in the present. The course will culminate in student-led case studies of other classical civilizations from around the world, such as the Mayan, Aztec, Japanese, Chinese, Nubian, or South Asian societies.",

Class time will be devoted to work in conjunction with the Norton Family Center for Common Good and the Pearse Hub for Innovation to design projects to bring Music and Social Action topics, questions, and queries to the greater Loomis Chaffee community. In addition, students will meet with guest speakers and performers to better understand the role and process of creating or presenting music for social action. (Sample course topics: Lin Manuel Miranda\u2019s work for Puerto Rico, El Sistema, revolutionary folk music in Chile, the music of Sixto Rodriguez, the choral revolution in Estonia, Band Aid, and the musical Hamilton.)",
